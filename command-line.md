The command line is a tool used by people who work with computers i.e. web developers, to quickly and efficiently navigate a computer and execute simple processes, such as creating, moving, and copying files. It is done through accessing something known as "the terminal", a window where you type in valid commands for your computer to run.
Here are some commands:

1. pwd
"print working directory" shows you which directory you're working in. A directory is basically a folder.

2. cd
"change directory" allows you to move either up, down, or to a specified directory.

3. ls
"list" will show you all the folders in the directory that you're currently in. You can add other letters or "tags" to the command to give it extra functions, such as displaying additional information about the files such as when they were created.

4. mkdir
"make directory" creates a new directory.

5. rm
"remove" allows you to remove a specified file from a directory.

6. rm -r
Deletes a directory and all directories it contains.

7. touch
Creates a specified file in the directory you're currently in.

8. cp
"copy" allows you to copy a specified file into a directory.

9. mv
"move" allows you to move a specified file into a different directory.

10. cat
Allows you to view a specified file.
